# Estimation of spatial stochastic frontier models

This `R`-package (under development), paper, and presentation are about stochastic spatial frontier (ssf) models. 
There are already a couple of papers about this topic, but I am not yet very convinced by them. Instead this paper and code provides a different approach to estimating a stochastic frontier model with spatially autocorrelated errors. 

## History

This paper has a long history. The original idea originated from Raymond J.G.M. Florax about already 10 years ago. I started working on this 8 years ago then let it rest for a *while* and now finally decided to give it a proper go.

## Contents of the repository
1. An `R` package (still under development)
2. A paper containing
    - other literature,
    - methodology, 
    - simulation, 
    - and a empirical application on European regional production functions.
3. Presentation I gave on this in Marburg (2014) and the presentation to be presented in Dijon (2018)
