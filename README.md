# Estimation of spatial stochastic frontier models

This `R`-package (under development), paper, and presentation are about stochastic spatial frontier models (ssfa). 
There are already a couple of papers about this topic, but I am not yet very convinced by them. 
About five or six years ago I started on this project, then let it rest for a while and now finally decided to give it a proper go.

## Contents of the repository
1. An `R` package
2. A paper (has to completely be rewritten) containing
    - other literature,
    - methodology, 
    - simulation, 
    - and a empirical application
3. Presentation I gave on this in Marburg (2014)
