	Abstract = {The paper examines the debates regarding place-neutral versus place-based policies for economic development. The analysis is set in the context of how development policy thinking on the part of both scholars and international organizations has evolved over several decades. Many of the previously accepted arguments have been called into question by the impacts of globalization and a new response to these issues has emerged, a response both to these global changes and also to nonspatial development approaches. The debates are highlighted in the context of a series of major reports recently published on the topic. The cases of the developing world and the European Union are used as examples of how in this changing context development intervention should increasingly focus on efficiency and social inclusion at the expense of an emphasis on territorial convergence and how strategies should consider economic, social, political, and institutional diversity in order to maximize both the local and the aggregate potential for economic development.},

	Abstract = {A large amount of literature provides empirical evidence in support of Marshall or Jacobs theories regarding the specialization or diversity effects on the economic performance of regions. This paper surveys these scholarly contributions and summarizes their results according to their similarities and differences. The reviewed empirical work presents a diverse picture of possible conditions and circumstances under which each kind of externalities could be at work. The wide breadth of findings is generally not explained by differences in the strength of agglomeration forces across industries, countries or time periods, but by measurement and methodological issues. The levels of industrial and geographical aggregation together with the choice of performance measures, specialization and diversity indicators are the main causes for the lack of resolution in the debate. The 3-digit industrial classification seems to be the level at which MAR and Jacobs effects are undistinguishable from one another, and this is often exacerbated by a high level of geographical aggregation.

Results using either a random or fixed effects method suggest that existing estimates of technical inefficiency in centrally planned economies may be biased downward because of the choice of the estimation method.

	Abstract = {By 2030 more than sixty percent of the world's population will live in urban areas, with most of the world's population growth over the next twenty-five years being absorbed by cities and towns in low and middle income countries. What are the consequences of this shift? Demographic pressure already strains the capacity of local and national governments to manage urban change. Today, nearly one billion people live in slums, and in the absence of significant intervention that number is set to double in the next two decades. Will our future be dominated by mega-cities of poverty and despair, or can urbanization be harnessed to advance human and economic development?

Cities and Development provides a critical exploration of the dynamic relationship between urbanism and development. Highlighting both the challenges and opportunities associated with rapid urban change, the book surveys:

    the historical relationship between urbanization and development
    the role cities play in fostering economic growth in a globalizing world
    the unique characteristics of urban poverty and the poor record of interventions designed to tackle it
    the complexities of managing urban environments; issues of urban crime, violence, war and terrorism in contemporary cities
    the importance of urban planning, governance and politics in shaping city futures. 

This book brings into conversation debates from urban and development studies and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of current policy and planning responses to the contemporary urban challenge. It includes research orientated supplements in the form of summaries, boxed case studies, development questions and further reading. The book is intended for senior undergraduate and graduate students interested in urban, international and development studies, as well as policy-makers and planners concerned with equitable and sustainable urban development.},

Econometrically the model is similar to a class of models that arise in specifying technical inefficiency in cost-minimizing and profit.-maximizing frameworks. The standard maximum likelihood (ML) method that is used to estimate output-oriented (OO) technical efficiency cannot be applied to estimate these models. We use a simulated ML approach to estimate the IO production function and compare results from the IO and OO models, mainly to emphasize the point that estimated efficiency, returns to scale, technical change, etc., differ depending on whether one uses the model with IO or OO technical inefficiency.

	Abstract = {The concept of competitiveness has grown significantly and it is now common for cities, regions and nations to assess, improve and publicise their competitive standing vis-a-vis other places. Yet it remains rather unclear just what competitiveness is when applied to places, which have objectives distinct from those of private-sector organisations, for whom share price and profitability serve as common metrics. The blurring of the responsibilities of the public and private sectors also complicates matters, with the former making increasing use of the terminology and priorities of business. This paper takes the view that both public and private sectors-and their interactions-are sustained by networks. To be effective, these networks must operate at the global, national, regional and local scales, gathering knowledge via social interaction-that is, through 'soft' networks. To a growing degree, competitive networking also demands technological capability, whether in high-tech sectors, 'smokestack' industries or public-sector organisations. This capability now demands 'hard' networks that 'plug into' the Internet. Decisions about the location of this infrastructure are largely in the hands of the private sector, responding to agglomeration economies and other 'imperatives' of the business world. The Internet also has created a new set of imperatives regarding information flow, since any competitive organisation must have an informative and 'user-friendly' website. Such new demands continue to 'raise the bar' regarding what urban competitiveness means.},

The model allows technical inefficiency to vary over time, and inefficiency effects to be a function of a set of explanatory variables in which the level and composition of public capital plays an important role. Results indicate that U.S. state inefficiency levels are significantly and positively correlated with the ratio of public capital to private capital. The proportion of public capital devoted to highways is negatively correlated with technical inefficiency, suggesting that not only the level but also the composition of public capital influences state efficiency},

@article{Thissen2010,
	Abstract = {The inherent tension between regional equality and economic growth (efficiency) is recently much debated in the context of place based development policy and agglomeration in the European Union. A general conclusion reached in the literature is that a policy targeted at regional equality may be harmful for economic growth. Such policy therefore should be transformed in such a way that it also promotes the mobility of both people and firms and hence facilitates the possibilities of increased agglomeration. Recent insights from economic theories suggest that agglomeration externalities are not taken into account in the migration decision of firms and people, causing the dynamic urbanisation processes to not necessarily result in a (social) welfare optimum. This is even more so if other welfare effects than GDP and product variety are taken into account. Regional economic development is not sustainable if the dynamic urbanisation processes stemming from agglomeration economies do not lead to a welfare optimum. In this paper we assess the possibility of a non-sustainable regional development path. We conclude that strong additional negative externalities of growing large agglomerations are harder to prove than negative externalities of small agglomerations becoming smaller. Moreover, the size of short run negative effects that will stimulate the migration of people has not been adequately assessed. The European Union should therefore be careful in interpreting place-based costs and benefits of growing, large agglomerations at the detriment of small regions.},

	Abstract = {Networks of interaction have assumed particular significance in recent years because of their presumed importance for learning and innovation. Alliances between related firms are thought to encourage interactive learning between participating organizations through the sharing of knowledge and information, which is itself facilitated through trust, shared values and ways of working. The vast body of literature that has emerged is, however, incredibly fragmented, encompassing an array of theoretical positions and perspectives. This paper focuses upon two issues which are believed to be of particular significance and which need clarification in order to move to a clearer understanding of the ways in which networks of interaction evolve, and of their capabilities and limitations in relation to economic performance and competitiveness: (1) the importance of network structure, arguing that innovative activity requires flexibility with regard to network formation. (2) The role of geography in relation to the construction and functioning of alliances. It is the contention here that networks are likely to be increasingly international in scope.},

Although the corporate reach of multinational corporations (MNCs) is clearly global, the geographical scope of their activities remains limited. Focusing on the network of ownership relations between the global Fortune 100 MNC headquarters and their subsidiaries, it is shown that global corporate activity remains unevenly distributed across the globe. Besides showing that richer countries are better connected within the global system than the poorer countries, the authors also reveal considerable differences in connectivity within the group of rich countries. Based on various determinants, these variations in network connectivity are explained. {\copyright} 2011 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.},

	Abstract = {Traditional panel stochastic frontier models do not distinguish between unobserved individual heterogeneity and inefficiency. They thus force all time-invariant individual heterogeneity into the estimated inefficiency. Greene (2005) proposes a true fixed-effect stochastic frontier model which, in theory, may be biased by the incidental parameters problem. The problem usually cannot be dealt with by model transformations owing to the nonlinearity of the stochastic frontier model. In this paper, we propose a class of panel stochastic frontier models which create an exception. We show that first-difference and within-transformation can be analytically performed on this model to remove the fixed individual effects, and thus the estimator is immune to the incidental parameters problem. Consistency of the estimator is obtained by either N -> infinity or T -> infinity, which is an attractive property for empirical researchers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved},
